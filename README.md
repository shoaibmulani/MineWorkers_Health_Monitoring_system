# MineWorkers_Health_Monitoring_system
This project is a wireless health monitoring system for mineworkers. It uses an ESP8266 microcontroller, a MAX30102 heart rate sensor, and an MQ9 gas sensor to monitor the heart rate and carbon monoxide levels of the mineworker. The data is then transmitted to a cloud server from there, it is showcased on a real-time hosted website (https://heaealthmonitaring.weebly.com/)
